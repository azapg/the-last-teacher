The Last Teacher
---
The Last Teacher is a platform to practice writing using LLMs. It is part of an experiment to assess the best ways of using powerful AIs as scaffolding to reduce the IQ gap between an AI and a person.

This experiment comes from the idea that, someday, an AI will outsmart every human. Would it be possible in that case, to use superintelligence to make humans even smarter than when superintelligence didn't exist? To use them as mentors and leverage their intelligence to at least keep up with their decisions.

The actual version of this project as August 2025 doesn't get anywhere near to respond such complicated question, but to build an AI tool with the purpuse of making itself obsolete by making you competent. Right now it is done through writing. The goal is to practice with the tutor to get exceptional at writing. Here are the rules:

* The student has to develop its own style. _We don't humanity imitating how AI talks_.
* Work in all types of writing: tweets, blogs, papers, poetry, etc.
* Learn to structure ideas intuitively, not just mimic formats.
* Avoid dependence. Once the learning is done, you should be able to write well without AI at all.

You might be thinking, this is just an AI mentor! And yes, it completely is. The reason of all the philosophical decoration is to make emphasis on the importance on making AI mentors that can distill superintelligence into us and avoid dependence on their intelligence. This goal might seem too ambitious for the current writing mentor app, but in the future, reasoning and math mentors could make the project more interesting, considering some of these systems have [solved novel problems](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/).

> This is part of an ongoing experiment, the platform is still in development and it might receive breaking changes based on the taste and opinions of the author.

# Some project goals
There are still a lot of things missing in the system. The main goal is to have a mentor that remembers preferences and styles, what feedback works for you and what doesn't, a chat to directly discuss ideas and feedback (this should be secondary, I anticipate this creating dependency) and in general, to feel smarter and present. Here are some ideas that come to mind (you are invited to suggest more)
* [ ] Allowing to use different languages at the smae time for polyglots
* [ ] Allowing students to learn from writers they like
* [ ] The mentor suggest you to rewrite certain texts or asks your opinion about them (to assess not only your writing, but your capacity of recognizing ideas in great writing, for example)
* [ ] When practicing different writing styles the app should morph to evaluate you differently. Writing for twitter isn't the same as writing for a science paper. When writing for social media it should teach you to sell yourself (unless you explicitly tell it not to, and you follow your own style) and for scientific papers it should force you to not be vague ...

# Quickstart
This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app. To run it, first run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# About the naming and possible missconceptions
Regardless of the poetic and ominous name, this project isn't meant to serve as some benchmark or real attempt to deal with the complex potential relationship between some super intelligent system and humans. This is mostly a weekend project to test how good an AI mentor can get without making the student develop co-dependence. 

I am still interested in that, in using AI to not get that far behind, and to use it as leverage for human intelligence. Maybe future versions of the platform that teach you reasoning and math skills would be more interesting for that purpose.
